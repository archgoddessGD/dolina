A close-up, front-facing shot of a small, incredibly fuzzy bright green alien creature that looks like a cat. It has two long, thin antennae with rounded ends sticking up from its head. The creature's face is barely visible through its thick green fur, showing two dark, squinted eyes. Two realistic human hands are holding a pair of silver semi-automatic pistols, pointing them directly at the viewer in a threatening but comical way. The background is a blurry, out-of-focus mix of earthy brown and grey tones. The overall image has a surreal, meme-like quality, with a humorous and absurdly aggressive mood.
