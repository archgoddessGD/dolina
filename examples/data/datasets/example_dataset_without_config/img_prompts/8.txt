A close-up, eye-level photo of three fluffy cats sitting together in a tight, affectionate group on a patch of grass. An orange tabby cat on the left and a brown mackerel tabby on the right are sitting upright, side-by-side. The orange cat has a proud, slightly squinty look, while the brown tabby has a calm and steady gaze. Nestled in front of them is a smaller white cat with brown tabby markings on its head and back, lying down in a relaxed loaf position and looking directly at the camera with a gentle, content expression. The scene is lit with soft, natural daylight. The background is a soft-focus bokeh of green foliage and distant blue mountains, making the cats the clear focus. The overall mood is serene, warm, and peaceful.
