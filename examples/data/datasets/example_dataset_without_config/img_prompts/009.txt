A close-up shot of an adorable, tiny orange tabby kitten standing upright on its hind legs. The kitten has soft ginger fur with a fluffy white patch on its chest and belly. Its most striking features are its huge, dark, soulful brown eyes that make it look innocent and slightly sad, almost like it's begging for something. It has a small pink nose and long white whiskers. The kitten is looking directly up at the camera with a vulnerable and heart-melting expression. The background is a simple, neutral-toned light beige carpet, keeping all the focus on the cute little cat.
