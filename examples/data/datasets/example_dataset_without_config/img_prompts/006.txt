A close-up, head-on shot of an orange tabby cat's face. The cat is staring directly into the lens with a hilarious, judgmental, and sleepy expression. Its green-hazel eyes are half-closed and droopy, as if it’s just woken up or is completely unimpressed. It has a white muzzle and chin area, a small pink nose, and long, prominent white whiskers fanning out from its cheeks. The lighting is soft, and the background is a blurry, out-of-focus indoor scene.
