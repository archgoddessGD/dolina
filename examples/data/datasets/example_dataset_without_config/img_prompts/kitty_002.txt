A close-up, blurry photo of a fluffy white cat with a look of extreme shock and surprise. The cat's large round blue eyes are wide open and glistening as if it's about to cry, with bright reflections in them. Its mouth is hanging open in a tiny gasp, showing a bit of its pink lip. The framing is tight on the cat's face, highlighting its comical expression of bewilderment and disbelief. The soft white fur and delicate whiskers are visible in this expressive, meme-like portrait.
