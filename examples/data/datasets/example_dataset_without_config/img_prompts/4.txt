A funny, close-up photo of an orange and white tabby cat's face, looking straight up into its big, wide eyes. The cat has massive, dark dilated pupils and is staring right at the lens with a curious, goofy look. Its pink nose and puffy white cheeks are very close to the camera, and its long white whiskers are sticking out in every direction. The shot has a wide-angle, almost fisheye lens feel, making the cat's head look perfectly round. Behind the cat, there's a room with a white bed and a wall hanging that has a black geometric design on it. The whole picture is framed by a thick, bright red border, and it has the slightly grainy, low-quality look of an internet meme.
