A grainy, low-resolution black and white photo of a surreal creature that looks like a white cat but only has two legs, a head, and a tail. It is missing its entire torso, with the head and a thick, furry tail attached directly to the top of its two legs. The creature is caught mid-stride, walking across a flat, paved ground with a textured stone wall in the background. The overall image has a bizarre, uncanny, and eerie "cursed image" vibe, looking like a weirdly edited or glitched real-life photograph.
