A close-up, front-facing portrait of a  tabby cat with a judgmental expression. The cat has a round face with full cheeks, a pink nose, and squinted greenish eyes that make it look unimpressed or sleepy. Its fur is a mix of brown, grey, and tan tabby patterns with a lighter chin. It's sitting inside a woven wicker basket. The lighting is bright and sunny from the side, highlighting the texture of its coat. The background is dark and blurry, with a small red car visible in the distance.
